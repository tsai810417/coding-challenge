# Goat Latin
#
#
# A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.
#
# We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)
#
# The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:
#
# If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append "ma" to the end of the word.
# For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
#
# If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
# For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
#
# Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
# For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end and so on.
# Return the final sentence representing the conversion from S to Goat Latin.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: "I speak Goat Latin"
# Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"

# Input: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

# Baseball Game

# Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
# "+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
# "D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
# "C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
# Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.
#
# You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]

# Example 2:
# Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
# Output: 27
# Explanation:
# Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
# Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
# Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
# Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.

#
# At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

# The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]

# 791. Custom Sort String
# S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.
#
# S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.
#
# Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.
#
# Example :
# Input:
# S = "cba"
# T = "abcd"
# Output: "cbad"
# Explanation:
# "a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
# Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
#
#
# Note:
#
# S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
# T has length at most 200.
# S and T consist of lowercase letters only.

# @param {String} s
# @param {String} t
# @return {String}

# 566. Reshape the Matrix
# In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.
#
# You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.
#
# The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
#
# If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# nums =
# [[1,2],
#  [3,4]]
# r = 1, c = 4
# Output:
# [[1,2,3,4]]
# Explanation:
# The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
# Example 2:
# Input:
# nums =
# [[1,2],
#  [3,4]]
# r = 2, c = 4
# Output:
# [[1,2],
#  [3,4]]
# Explanation:
# There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
# Note:
# The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
# The given r and c are all positive.

# @param {Integer[][]} nums
# @param {Integer} r
# @param {Integer} c

# 766. Toeplitz Matrix
# A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.
#
# Now given an M x N matrix, return True if and only if the matrix is Toeplitz.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# 1234
# 5123
# 9512
#
# In the above grid, the diagonals are "[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]", and in each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
# Output: False
# Explanation:
# The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
# Note:
#
# matrix will be a 2D array of integers.
# matrix will have a number of rows and columns in range [1, 20].
# matrix[i][j] will be integers in range [0, 99].

# 75. Sort Colors
# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
#
# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
#
# Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
# Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
# Follow up:
#
# A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
# First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
# Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

# The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
#
# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 1 or 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
#              or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
# Note:
#
# Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
