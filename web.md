### What is RESTful means     
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer
- A set of design principles for making network communication more scalable and flexible

### The Fielding Constraints     
Architectural constraints that a system must satisfy to be considered RESTful
#### Client-server
- server: a computer has resources of interest
- client: a computer that wants to interact with the resources stored on the server

When browsing the Internet, your computer is acting as a client and sends HTTP requests to a server to access and manipulate informations.
A RESTful system has to operate in the client-sever model.

A non-RESTful alternative to client-server architecture is event-based integration architecture. Each component continuously broadcasts events while listening for pertinent events from other components. There's no one-to-one communication. REST requires one-to-one communication, so event-based integration architecture would not be RESTful.
